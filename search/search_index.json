we have run for this tests Abbreviation: IAR - Initial adaptive refinement, LR - Longitude Repetitions, MRFH - Minimum refinement function of Harzburgite layer, MRFS - Minimum refinement function of slab In this group: IAR11LR1 IAR11LR2 IAR11LR3 IAR8LR1 IAR8LR2 IAR8LR3 In group kyoma_mesh_refinement_1 IAR3LR1 IAR3LR2 IAR3LR3 IAR4LR1 IAR4LR2 IAR4LR3 In group kyoma_mesh_refinement_2 IAR10LR1MRFH6MRFS8 IAR10LR2MRFH6MRFS8 IAR10LR3MRFH6MRFS8 In group kyoma_mesh_refinement_3 IAR10LR1MRFH4MRFS6 IAR10LR2MRFH4MRFS6 IAR10LR3MRFH4MRFS6 Issue on composition with minimum refinement function only clear error: IAR11LR1 light lines, and blue that interupts what should be red. See the PvMesh0 picture in this case. subtle error: IAR8LR2, IAR8LR3 lighter blue or red on coarser mesh, with darker blue or red inside the square on finer mesh. fine: IAR8LR1, IAR11LR3 what happens to the IAR11LR2 case which should be the same as a previous case? Comments by Magali on this group On setting of the Solver parameters subsection Solver parameters set Composition solver tolerance = 1e-12 set Temperature solver tolerance = 1e-12 subsection Stokes solver parameters set Linear solver tolerance = 1e-7 end end You should set all these values to large numbers (1e-5).. so you can get through the first time-step very quickly. The mesh refinement with just the minimum refinement function does not depend on the solution in anyway. Possible causasion of the error A combination of: geometry a combination of d the repetitions and total number of elements total mesh refinement > minimux refinement function Next group of tests try instead to keep the initial adaptive mesh refinement to a fixed value (maybe 10), and then decrease the values in the minimum refinement function to 8 and 6. And then run this with repetitions of 1, 2 and 3. Then reduce it to 6 and 4 and repeat the test with repetitions = 1, 2, and 3. about setting the values in the minimum refinment function apparently we should be using 1 or more consistently Nature of the error detected The nature of this error is detected by comparison with this other case kyoma_mesh_refinementULV3.000e+01testIAR11. These two cases have identical input parameters. However, Paraview yields different plots where this is no error in this group and an error in the previous case. Thus we have a suspicision that this is due to Paraview. Which is again conformed by later tests. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are from the same case kyoma_mesh_refinementULV3.000e+01testIAR11, but they have different results in Paraview. 3 is the luchy correct result. However when 3 and 4 are ploted in points, they are not so different. The results from visit seem all fine.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"kyoma_mesh_refinement/summary/#group-kyoma_mesh_refinement","text":"","title":"Group

of too much refinement by the 'strain rate' strategy, see case ULV3.000e+01testRF9.000e-01ST1.000e-05, by testing with no initial solving. Too much refined by the 'strain rate' strategy from ULV3.000e+01testRF9.000e-01ST1.000e-05 compare this to the previous case, there are three regions that are refined additionally by the combination of initial solving and 'strain rate' strategy. Far in the mantle wedge Below the slab and a 'rolling'-like structure Below the subducting plate area adjacent to the slab is marked to coarsen in the additional refinement compare the two cases in

initial solving' with only minimum refinement function and with whole group of strategies, continued from group kyoma_mesh_refinement4 However, in this group, I set frac=1.0, thus I only captured the shape of the slab strictly effect of additional mesh For case RF9.000e-01testORF0, if we go from the surface to deeper region, we will see: \"Big Mac\" - like refinement: The slab is refined of coarse, and the boundary is refined by additional refinement regional adjacent to slab and crust is not refined by additional refinement, this may be caused by temperature. Region in deeper lithosphere is refined by additional refinement same pature of 2 and 3 shows again in deeper region, thus we have three layers of finer grids with 2 layers of coarser grids in between addtional refinement of lower upper mantle lower upper mantle is refined to finer grid that shallower mantle region ultra-refinement of the 660 even finer grid around the 660 than lower upper mantle. This should be caused by the difference in viscosity. total dof there are 3e6 dof in total

strain rate Refinement of chemical boundaries for case with only compositional gradient The boudary between crust and harzburgite layer is more refined that the boundary between slab and mantle. for case with strain rate, this is similar with case with only compositional gradient, as we don't solve initial-mesh stokes. for case with all strategies All chemical boundaries are well refined for case with viscosity This is similar to case with all strategies Refinemment of core mantle boudary for case with all strategy It is refined to be 3 levels finer that ambient for case with viscosity This is

with minimum refinement function only clear error: IAR3LR1, IAR4LR1 light lines, and blue that interupts what should be red. See the PvMesh0 picture in this case. subtle error: IAR3LR3 lighter blue or red on coarser mesh, with darker blue or red inside the square on finer mesh. fine or perhaps subtler error: IAR3LR2, IAR4LR2, IAR4LR3 Haoyuan's comments We have IAR = 3 for these case and our Initial global refinement = 6, which means we are at 9 for a maximux refinement. This would be differenet from previous group with Initial global refinement = 10. Thus we can compare this two groups. comparison Eliminate additional vacant refinement doesn't prevent the error from happening, so that should not be the reason. This group is consistent with previous group to present clear error in cases with LR=1. LR has to be related with the problem. Go from IAR4 ot IAR3 doesn't solve the problem. So higher order of actual mesh doesn't seem to be the problem What I want to do for the next test We could follow the idea of creating a simpler test case, where we may see this at coaser refinement level. We could test the catesian geometry to assert that this is not a problem there.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"kyoma_mesh_refinement_1/summary/#group-kyoma_mesh_refinement_1","text":"","title":"Group

to refinement of slab to 8 and harzburgite layer to 6, now it's harder to discern from the plots. Delineated subtle error only for LR3 see the PvMesh0.png in case. Ohnestly, I am not even sure about this. Seemly fine for LR2, and probably for LR1 Comments from Haoyuan Under current setting, we can only go to refinement level 9, smaller value is indiscernable.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"kyoma_mesh_refinement_2/summary/#group-kyoma_mesh_refinement_2","text":"","title":"Group
